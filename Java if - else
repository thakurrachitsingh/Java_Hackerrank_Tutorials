Task
Given an integer,

, perform the following conditional actions:

    If 

is odd, print Weird
If
is even and in the inclusive range of to
, print Not Weird
If
is even and in the inclusive range of to
, print Weird
If
is even and greater than

    , print Not Weird

Complete the stub code provided in your editor to print whether or not

is weird.

Input Format

A single line containing a positive integer,

.

Constraints

Sample Input 0

3 

Sample Output 0

Weird

Sample Input 1

Solution:


import java.util.Scanner;
public class demo{
    public static void main(String[] args){
    Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
    int ob = sc.nextInt();
    if (ob % 2 == 0 && ((ob >= 2 && ob <= 5) || ob > 20))
        System.out.println("Not Weird");
    else if (ob %2 != 0 || (ob % 2 ==0 && ob >= 6 && ob <= 20))
        System.out.println("Weird");
    }
